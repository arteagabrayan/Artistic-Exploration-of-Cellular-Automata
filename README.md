# Artistic Exploration of Cellular Automata: Bridging the Gap Between Rule-based Patterns and the Game of Life
This work explores the artistic potential of cellular automata in rule-based patterns and their integration with the Game of Life. The research aims to bridge the gap between mathematical modeling and visual art by presenting a method for generating captivating patterns using cellular automaton rules. It employs an 8-bit encoding scheme and vibrant color palettes to enhance the artistic appeal. Additionally, a simulation is developed to dynamically evolve the automaton and integrate it with the rules of the Game of Life, resulting in captivating and impressive artistic expressions. This interdisciplinary research highlights the connection between mathematics, computer science, and art, challenging traditional notions and inviting further exploration in this unique field. The paper emphasizes the significance of this interdisciplinary research and encourages continued exploration in bridging the gap between rule-based patterns and the Game of Life through cellular automata.

## Requirements
This repository was developed in the Python 3.10.9 programming language.

## Package installation

We highly recommend to use and install Python packages within an Anaconda environment. To create, execute the command below:
```
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
```
```
conda create --name PhD python=3.10
```
```
pip install notebook
```
So, activate it:
```
conda activate PhD
```
Now, install the libraries
```
conda install -c anaconda keras-gpu
```
```
conda install jupyter 
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution
After installing all the Requirements, you must clone the repository using.
```
git clone https://github.com/arteagabrayan/Artistic-Exploration-of-Cellular-Automata.git
```
Enter the cloned folder, then open the folder and run the notebook.

If you will use Google Colab, upload the cloned folder to Google Drive, then open the folder and run the notebooks.
